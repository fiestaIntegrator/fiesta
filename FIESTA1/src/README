This directory contains the sources of the program CIntegrate which is
the C-part of FIESTA. Here is a brief description of the function of
each file:

CIntegrate.c -- the main file for the CIntegrate program.The program
is not supposed to start directly, it is launched from Mathematica via
the Mathlink protocol. See comments in the beginning of the file.

Link.tm -- the MathLink template for each external function. These
functions are defined in the file CIntegrate.c.

comdef.h -- global definitions.

scanner.c and scanner.h -- the translator of an incoming expression into
triples and quadruples, see comments in the beginning of the file scanner.c.

runline.c and runline.h -- the interpretor of the array of quadruples,
see comments in the beginning of the file runline.c.

vegas.f -- the Fortran VEGAS routine, close to the original Lepage code.
vegas.h -- definition of C API to VEGAS.

collectstr.c and collectstr.h -- several types of re-allocatable
arrays, see comments in the beginning of the file collectstr.h.

hash.c and hash.h -- the special CIntegrate-specific hash table, see
comments in the beginning of the file hash.h.

queue.h -- Inline implementation of the generic queues, see comments
in the beginning of the file.

mman.h -- simple Windows stubs for mmap(), munmap(), getpagesize() and off_t.

Makefile -- the Unix makefile.
CIntegrate.mak -- the Windows makefile.
