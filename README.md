FIESTA stands for Feynman Integral Evaluation by a Sector decomposiTion
Approach.

FIESTA originated by A. Smirnov in collobaration with M. Tentyukov.
The current version of FIESTA is being developed together with V. Smirnov.

FIESTA is written partially in Wolfram Mathematica and partially in C
(former version also requires some Fortran code).

FIESTA is distributed under the terms of GNU GPLv2.

FIESTA is based on the sector decomposition approach to the numerical
evaluation of Feynman integrals originally applied by G.Heinrich and T.Binoth
(there is a public algorithm performing a similar task by C.Bogner and
S.Weinzierl).

A paper with FIESTA_1.0.0 is available from the Computer Physics
Communications site or arXiv:0807.4129.

The Speer sectors strategy is applicable only for a subclass of diagrams and
to use it one requires to provide also the diagram structure; for details see
arXiv:0812.4700.
