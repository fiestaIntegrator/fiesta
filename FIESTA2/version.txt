Version 2.3:

comes with a new package of sources and binaries

- fixed a bug for non-integer indices
- fixed warnings for Mathematica 7 and 8
- new option for square resolution: AdvancedSquares3 (works better on threshhold)
- new non-obligatory argument for SDEvaluateDirect to provide a list of delta-functions
- better debugging with IntegrationDebug
- new sector decomposition strategies STRATEGY_KU0, STRATEGY_KU, STRATEGY_KU2 (Kaneko, Ueda). 
KU2 is slowest, but less sectors. KU0 is fastest, but more sectors
- new boolean option PolesMultiplicity, if true, forces the SDAnalyze mode to provide poles multiplicities as well
- bug fix - intrepolation near the origin did not actually work as expected,
resulting in integration errors in some specific situations
- bug fix - integration crashed when one of the exponents exceeded 13312
