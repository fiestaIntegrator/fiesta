Installation the Mathematica part.

Please note that the code requires Wolfram Mathematica 6.0 or 7.0
(recommended) to be installed and will not work correctly under lower
versions of Mathematica.

1.Copy the file FIESTA_2.0.0.m to the proper location, e.g
cp FIESTA_2.0.0.m /home/user/FIESTA/FIESTA_2.0.0.m

2. Edit the default paths QLinkPath, CIntegratePath and DataPath in
the file FIESTA_2.0.0.m, e.g.
QLinkPath="/home/user/QLink/QLink";
CIntegratePath="/home/user/FIESTA/CIntegrate";
DataPath="/tmp/user/temp";

Here QLinkPath is a  path to the executable QLink file,
CIntegratePath is a  path to the executable CIntegrate file,
DataPath is a path to the database. FIESTA creates three files,
appendig "1", "2" and "3" to the name provided by DataPath, i.e., in
the above mentioned example three files will be used, /tmp/user/temp1,
/tmp/user/temp2 and /tmp/user/temp3.
Note, FIESTA might produce a big traffic to the directory DataPath so
it is preferable to use some fast local disk with enough free space.

For the Windows system, these paths should look like
QLinkPath="C:/programs/QLink/QLink.exe";
CIntegratePath="C:/programs/FIESTA/CIntegrate.exe";
DataPath="D:/temp";

Note that the program will create a big IO traffic to the directory
\verb|DataPath|, therefore, it is better to put this directory on a fast
local disk.

Installation QLink.

Copy to the proper location the file QLink32 for 32-bit Linux or the
file QLink64 for 64-bit Linux or QLink.exe for Windows, e.g.
cp QLink32 /home/user/FIESTA/QLink

The latest verson of QLink can be downloaded as a binary file or
compiled from the sources, see
http://www-ttp.particle.uni-karlsruhe.de/~asmirnov/QLink.htm

Installation CIntegrate.

Copy to the proper location the executable file CIntegrate, e.g.
cp CIntegrateMP32 /home/user/FIESTA/CIntegrate

There are two families of pre-compiled binaries in the distribution,
CIntegrate and CIntegrateMP (recommended). CIntegrate uses the native
IEEE floating-point arithmetic, it is faster but much more
restrictive.  CIntegrateMP uses the MPFR multi-precision library if
necessary, it is slightly slower than CIntegrate but it should produce
a correct result for almost all integrals, so we strongly recommend to
use CIntegrateMP.

CIntegrateMP32   multiprecision version for 32-bit Linux
CIntegrateMP64   multiprecision version for 64-bit Linux
CIntegrateMP.exe multiprecision version for Windows

CIntegrate32     native floating-point arithmetic for 32-bit Linux
CIntegrate64     native floating-point arithmetic for 64-bit Linux
CIntegrate.exe   native floating-point arithmetic for Windows

If the user wants to compile the executable file himself he must have
several software packages to be installed on his computer.

First, the Mathematica Developer Kit. It sould be installed if the
user has the official Wolfram Mathematica installation.

The CIntegrate program depends on the MPFR library http://www.mpfr.org
and the Cuba library http://www.feynarts.de/cuba

After installing MPFR and the Cuba library
the user has to edit the self-explanatory Makefile and run the command "make". 
Then, two executable files should appear, CIntegrate and
CIntegrateMP. Th first one uses the native IEEE floating-point
arithmetic while CIntegrateMP uses the MPFR multi-precision
library if necessary. CIntegrateMP is slightly slower than CIntegrate but it 
should produce a correct result for almost
all integrals, so we strongly recommend to use CIntegrateMP.

The C-sources are situated in the subdirectory "sources". The
program CIntegrate is compiled in the subdirectory "native"
and the program CIntegrateMP is compiled in the subdirectory
"mpfr". After successful compilation both executable files are moved
to the root FIESTA directory. In order to clean up the directory
structure, the user may use the command "make clean".

Under Windows the compilation should be performed under the Cygwin environment. 
In this case, the executable files will get
the extension ".exe".
